# Valorant API Project

## Project description
In this project, I took a first dive into the use of APIs. I made use of the Valorant API. I show some properties of each agent from Valorant. 
Namely:
- Agent icon (profile picture)
- Agent background
- Agent name
- Agent description
- Names of each ability
- Icons of each ability
- Description of each ability
- Voiceline of the agent

In short, on this webpage you can basically find everything about each agent in Valorant. Because the API updates itself every so often, all new agents will automatically be added to the web page.
